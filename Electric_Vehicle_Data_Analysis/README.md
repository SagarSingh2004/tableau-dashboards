# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard – Tableau 📊

📌 Project Overview  
This project showcases an interactive Electric Vehicle (EV) Data Analysis Dashboard built using Tableau to analyze electric vehicle trends, top models, regional distribution, and CAFV eligibility. The dashboard helps stakeholders understand EV adoption, manufacturer trends, vehicle types, and incentive eligibility across different states.

Time Period Covered: 1997 – 2024  
Total Vehicles Analyzed: 150,475
